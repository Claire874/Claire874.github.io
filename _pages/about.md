Hi, there! I am a PhD student at [Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Tech)](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english?), advised by [Nakadai Kazuhiro](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=SBBBYM8AAAAJ&hl=en) and affiliated with [Nakadai Lab](https://www.ra.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/en/), Systems and Control Engineering. I am interested in multi-modal AI, especially in Computer Vision (CV) and NLP for sign language translation. I am also a visiting researcher at [NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories](https://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/english/vision/2_1.html), working on sign language technology.



I did my master's at Tokyo Tech where I graduated as [the Best Graduate](https://www.openbadge-global.com/ns/portal/openbadge/public/assertions/detail/QXgwK3JENW1yRGZURkJML0RIVXphZz09) from Systems and Control Engineering, and I did my undergrad at [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) advised by [Fan Xin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vLN1njoAAAAJ&hl=en) and graduated as one of the outstanding graduates.

I come from China and am doing my adventures in Japan. I am a tarot lover (my favorite card is [the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_%28tarot_card%29)) and a newbie in Pilates.<br>
